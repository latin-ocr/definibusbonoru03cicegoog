lwg. Mr nean liumus, —The following essay, Ι am ererace: cuo ic
laware attemptrng as rt doestopresent rna Latinsssss ren ιι333. ·
dress subjects that philosophers of consummate
ability and profound learning have already handled
in Greek, is sure to encounter criticism from different
’ quarters. Certain persons, and those not without
some preteusion to letters, disapprove of the study

of philosophy altogether. Others do not so greatly
· object to it provided 'it be followed in dilettante
fashion3 but they do not think it ought to engage so
large an amount of one's interest and attention. A
third class, learned in Greek literature and contemp-
tuous of Latin, will say that they prefer to spend their
time in reading Greek. Lastly, Ι suspect there will

be some who will wish to divert meto other fields of '
authorship, asserting that this kind of composition,
though a· graoeful recreation‚ is beneath the dignity
2 of my character and position. To all of these objec- >
tions Ι suppose Ι ought to ma esome brief reply. The {¹120 so uhu¹
· indiscriminate censure of philosophy has indeed been sut esd}v‚¹⁰⁸⁰
sufficiently answered already ιιι the book which l
wrote ιιι praise of that study, ιιι order to defend it
' against a bitter attack that had been made upon it
by Hortensius. The favourable reception which that
volume appeared to obtain from yourself and from
others whom Ι considered competent judges en·
couraged me to embark upon further undertakings3
for Ι did not wish to be thought incapable of sus-
taining the interest that I had succeeded in arousing.
