BOOK Ι, ἰίὶ

the Greeks as a philosopher. Still, you yourself
challenged me to the venture, by dedicating to me
your delightful essay On Virtuc. But Ι have no
doubt that the reason why some people take a
dislike to Latin literature is that they have happened
to meet with certain illiterate and uncouth produc-
tions which are bad Greek books in worse Latin
versions. I have no quarrel with these personS,
provided that they also refuse to read the Greek
writers on the sume subjects. But given a noble
theme, and a refined, dignified and graceful style,
who would not read a Latin book? Unless it be some
one ambitious to be styled a Greek out-and-out, as
9 Albucius was greeted by Scaevola when the latter

'was praetor at Athens. I am again referring to
Lucilius, who relates the anecdote with much neat-
ness and point; he puts the following excellent lines
into the mouth of Scaevola:

“ You vow’d, Albucius, that to suit ye

'Twas as a Greek we must repute ye;

‘Roman’ and ‘Sabine’ being names

Your man of ton and toste disclaims!

You scorn’d to own your native town,-

Which bore such captains of renown

As Pontius and Tritannius bold,

Who in the van Rome’s ensigns hold.

And so, at Athens when I lay,

And your respects you carne to pay,

My worship, humouring your freak,

Gave you good-morrow straight in Greek,

With ‘Charra Titus l' ‘Chaires bawl

Guards, aides-de-camps, javelin-men and all!

-Hence comes it that Albucius hates me,

Hence as his bitterest loe he rates me.”
