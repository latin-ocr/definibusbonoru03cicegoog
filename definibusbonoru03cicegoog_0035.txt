INTRODUCTION

the state of the MSS, for which the student must
go to Madvig.

· The best MSS. of de Finibus are: A, Palatinus I,

’ llth c., which ends soon aster the beginning of

Book IV; B, Palatinus 113 and E, Erlangensis, l5th c.
These three form one family, within which B and E

. are more closely related. The other MSS. known

to Madvig form a second family, inferior in general
to the former, though, as Miiller points out, not to
be entirely dispensed with. Both families according
to Madvig descend from a late and already consider-
ably corrupted archetype.

The earliest edition is believed to have been
printed at Cologne in 1467. Madvig's great com-
mentary (Copenhagen, 1889, 1869, 1876) supersedes
all its predecessors. There is a small annotated
edition, largely based upon Madvig, by W. M. L.
Hutchinson (London, 1909).
