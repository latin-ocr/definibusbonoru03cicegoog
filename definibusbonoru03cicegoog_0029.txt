As this world had a beginning, so it will have an
end in time; it is moving on towards a universal
conflagration, in which all things will return to the
primal F ire from which they sprang. But only for
a moment will unity be restored. The causes that
operated before must operate again3 once more the
creative process will begin, and all things will recur
exactly as they have occurred already. So existence
goes on, repeating itself in an unending series of

his reason matures, he learns (if unperverted) to

understand the plan of nature and to find his happi-
ness in willing conformity with it. This rightness of
