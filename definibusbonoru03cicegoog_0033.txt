INTRODUCTION

sion' was impossible, but yet there was a ‘clearness'

‚about some impressions that gives a conviction oi

their truth.

The next head, Antiochus, went beyond this
ambiguous position, and abandoned scepticism alto-
gether. Contradicting Philo, he maintained that
the true tradition of Plato had been lost, and pro-
fessed to recover it, calling his school the ‘Old
Academy.' But his reading of the history of philo-
sophy was hardly more accurate than Philo's. He

» asserted that the teachings of the older Academics

and Peripatetics and of the Stoics were, in Ethics
at all events, substantially the same, and that Zeno
had horrowed his tenets from his predecessors,
merely concealing the theft by his novel termin-
ology.

The latter thesis is argued in de Finibus, Book IV,
while Book V gives Antiochus’s version of the ‘Old
Academia and Peripatetic’ Ethics, which he himself
professed. His doctrine is that Virtue is sufficient
for happiness, but that in the highest degree of
happiness bodily and external goods also form a part.

'The Stoics will not call these latter ‘goods’ but

only ‘things promoted'3 yet really they attach no
less importance'to thern.

Antiochus could only maintain his position by
ignoring nice distinctions The Ethics of Aris-
totle in particular seem to have fallen into complete
oblivion. Aristotle's cardinal doctrines are, that
well-being consists notin the state of virtue but in
the active exercise of all human excellenceS, and
particularly of man's highest giit of rational con-
templation3 and that though for this a modicum of
external goods is needed, these are but indispensable
