spontaneous. To start w1th the body, do you notice The body

how men try to hide a deformed or infirm or maimed11 anona ‘mh'llssn‘th
limb? They actually take great pains and trouble ffilv‘ very
to conceal, if they possibly can, their bodily defect,
or at all events to let it be seen as little as possible;
they even undergo painful courses of treatment' rn
order to restore the natural appearance of their
limbs‚ even though the actual use of them will not
only not be improved but will even be diminished.

In fact, since every man instinctively thinks that he
himself in his entirety' is a thing to be desired, and
this not for the sake of anything else but for his own
sake, it follows that when a thing is desired as a
whole forits own sake, the parts also of that thing .

7 are desired for their own sakes. Again, is there
nothing in the movements and postures of the body
which Nature herself judges to be of importance? A
man's mode of walking and sitting, his particular
cast of features and expression? is there nothing in
these things that we consider worthy or unworthy ’
of a free man? Do we not often think people
deserving of dislike, who by some movement or
postu're appear to have violated a law or principle of
nature? And since people try to get rid of these
'defects of bearing, why should not even beauty
have a good claim to be considered as desirable
forits own sake? Foris we think imperfectiori or
mutilation of the body things to be avoided for their
own sake, why should we not with equal or perhaps
still greater reason pursue dignity of form for its
own sake? And if we avoid ugliness in bodily
movement and posture, why should we not pursue
beauty? Health also, and strength and freedom
from pain we shall desire not merely for their utility
