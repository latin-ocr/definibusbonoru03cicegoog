pursucs or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it
is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur
in which toil and pain can procurre him some great
pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever
undertakes laborious physical exercise‚ except to ob-
tain some advantage from it? But who has any right
to find fault witha man who chooses to enjoy a plea-
sure that has no annoying consequences, or one who
33 avoidsapainthat produces no resultant pleasure? On
the other hand, we denounce with righteous indigna-
tion and dislikc men who are so beguiled and demora-
lized hythe charms of the pleasure of the moment, so
blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain
and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame
belongs to those who fail in their duty through
weakness of will, whichis the same as saying through
shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are per-
fectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free honr,
when our power of choice is untrammelled and when
nothing prevents our being able to do what we like
best, every pleasurc is to be welcomed and every
pain avoided But in certain circumstances and
owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of
business it will frequently occur that pleasures have
to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise
,man therefore always holds in these matters to this
principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure
other greater pleasureS, or else he endures pains to

avoid worse pains.
