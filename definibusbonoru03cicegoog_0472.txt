BOOK V. xiii

attributes both of mind and body to be perfect,

our mind and body arc themselves dear to us for

their own sakes, and are of the highest importance

for our general well-being. For he who aims at the

preservation of himself, must necessarily feel an affec·

tion for the parts of himself also, and the more so,

the more perfect and admirable in their own kind

they are. For the life we desire is one fully equipped

with the virtues of mind and body; and such a life ’

must constitute the Chief Good, inasmuch as it must

necessarily be such as to be the limit of things desir-

able. This truth realized, it cannot be doubted that,

as men feel an affection towards themselves for their

own sakes and of their own accord, the parts also of ,

the body and mind, and of those faculties which are

displayed in each while in motion or at rest, arc

esteemed for their own attractiveness and desired' ¹
8 for their own sake. From these explanations, it apeuauyor

may readily be inferred that the most desirable of ffiffiffi

our attributes are those possessed of the highest {⁰133ssan

intrinsic worth3 so that the most desirable excel· mam

lences are the excellences of the noblest parts of us,

which are desirable for their own sake. The result

will be that excellence of mind will be rated higher

than excellence of body, and the volitional virtues

of the mind will surpass the non-volitional; the

former, indeed, arc the ‘virtues' specially so called,

and are far superior, in that they spring from reason,

the most divine clement in man. For the inanimate

or nearly inanimate creatures that are under nature's

charge, all of them have their supreme good in the

body; hence it has been cleverly said,as l think,about

the pig, that a mind hasbeen bestowed upon this

animal to serve as salt and keep it from going bad.
