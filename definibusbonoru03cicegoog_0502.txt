BOOK V. xxii

so unlike a human being as to feel no repulsion at
baseness and no approval for goodness? Who is
there that does not hate a youth spent in debauchery
and wantonness? Who on the contrary would not

esteem modesty and orderliness in the young, even
· though he has no personal concern in them? ·
Who does not hate the tra'itor·Pullus Numitorius of

Fregellae, although he did a service to our country?

Who does not praise and extol CodruS, the preserver
of this city, or honour the daughters of Erechtheus?
or loathe the very name of Tubulus? or love the
memory of Aristides? Do we forget the strong
emotion that we feel when we hear or read of some
53 deed of piety, of friendship or of magnanimity? But
Ι need not speak of ourselveS, whose birth, breeding ·
and education point us towards glory and towards
honour3 think of the uneducated multitude,—what
a tempest of applause rings through the theatre at
the words:
Ι am OresteS,

and at the rejoinder:
No, no, 'tis I, Ι say, I am Orestes.

And then when each offers a solution to the king in
his confusion and perplexity:

- Then prithee slay us both ; we’ll die together:

as osten as this scene‘ is acted, does it ever fail to
arouse the greatest enthusiasm? This proves that all
men without exception approve and applaud the dis-
position that not only seeks no advantage for itself,
but is loyal and true even to its own disadvantage.

romanoe but also of history, and especially the history
