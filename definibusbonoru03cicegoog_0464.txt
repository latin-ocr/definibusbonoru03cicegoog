recoil so violently from the dissolution of our being
(and the same timidity in regard to pain is blame-
worthy); but the fact that practically everybody has
this feeling is conclusive proof that nature shrinks
from destruction3 and the more some people act thus
—as indeed they do to a blameworthy degree—the

shun death because they believe it means the loss of
the good things of life, or because they are afraid

pains, nevertheless prolonged his life by fowling;

‘Slow he pierced the swift with arrows, standing
shot them on the wing,’
