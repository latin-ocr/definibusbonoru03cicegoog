trol through his adoption by Decius Silanus-when
he summoned him into his presence to answer to the
charge preferred against him by 3 deputation from
Macedonia, 01 accepting bribes while praetor in that
province-when, 31131 hearing both sides of the case,
he gave judgment that he found his 3011 guilty 01
having conducted himself in office in a manner un-
worthy 01 his ancestry, and banished him for ever
from his sight—think you· he had any regard 1011113

and preferring to undergo every sort of pain rather
than be false to any portion 01 their duty. Let us
turn to matters seemingly less important, but equally
15 conclusive. What actual pleasure do you, TorquatuS,
or does Triarius here, derive from literature, from
history and learning, from turning the pages 01 the
poets and committing vast quantities 01 13133 10

themselves a pleasure to you, and that so were the
deeds 1 mentioned to the Torquati. That line 01
defence was never taken by Epicurus or Metrodorus
nor by any one of them 11 he possessed any intelli·
gence or had mastered the doctrines 01 your school.
