BOOK I. ii-iii

MnesarchuS, Panaetius, and many others, not least
our friend Posidonius. Again, Theophrastus handles
topics previously treated by Aristotle, yet he gives
us no small pleasure all the same. Nor do the Epi-
cureans cease from writing as the spirit moves them

on the same questions on which Epicurus and the

doing3 just as Ennius regularly borrows from Homer,
and Afranius from Menander. Nor yet shall Ι object,
like our LuciliuS,a to all the world’s reading what Ι

and still more Scipio and Rutilius, in fear of whose
criticism Lucilius protests that he writes for the
publicos Tarentum, Consentia and Sicily. Here of

seriously. As a matter of fact, there were not such
learned critics in his day, to tax his best efforts3 and
also his writings are in a lighter vein: they show

need not be afraid of any reader, if I am so bold
as to dedicate my book to you, who rival even
