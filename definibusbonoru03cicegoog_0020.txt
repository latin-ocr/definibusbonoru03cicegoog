(1, 6) he rates his work a little higher‚ not without
justice, and claims to be the critic as well as the
interpreter of his authorities. ,

This method of writing was consonant with Cicero's

his principles, he accepted the verdict of the common
moral conscience of his age and country. Epicure·
anism he abhorred as demorahzing. The Stoics

ology. His competence for the task of interpreting
Greek thought to Rome was of a qualilied order.
He had read much, and had heard the chief teachers
of the day. But with learning and enthusiasm he
combined neither depth of insight nor scientific
precision. Yet his services to philosophy must not
be underrated. He introduced a novel style of ex-
position, copious, eloquent, impartial and urbane3
and he created a philosophieal terminology in Latin
which has passed into the languages of modern
Europe.
