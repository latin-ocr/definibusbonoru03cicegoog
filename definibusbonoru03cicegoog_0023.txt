INTRODUCTION

the empire of Macedon, and the barrier between
Greek and barbarian was giving way. The wars of
Alexander’s successors rendered all things insecure3
exile, slavery, violent death were possibilities with
which every man must lay his account
Epicureanism and Stoicism, however antagonistic,
have certain common features corresponding to the
needs of the period. Philosophy was systematized,
and fell into three recognized departments, Logic,
Physics and Ethics3 and for both schools the third
department stood first in importance. Both schools
offered dogma, not speculation; away of life for man

as man, not as Greek citizen. Both abandoned

idealism, saw ιιο realifflsave-ma‘tter, ηιξ-’ἕξοι ted
sense experience ,ιι knowledge. Both studied the
world of nature only m order to understand the
position of man. Both looked for a happiness
secure from fortune' s changes3 and found it ιιι peace
of mind, undisturbed by sear and desire. But here
the rival teochers diverged: Epicurus sought peace
in the liberation of manl’s will from nature's law,
Zeno' ιιι submission to it; l'and ιιι their conceptions
of nature they differed profoundly.

Formal Logic Epicurus dismissed as useless, but
he raised the problem of knowledge under the
heading of Canonic. The Οαιιοιι οι measuring-rod,
the criterion of truth, is fumished by the sensations
and by the πάθη οι feelings of pleasure and pain.
Epicurus’s recognition of the latter as qualities of
any state of consciousness and as distinct from the
sensations of sight, hearing, etc, marks a notoble
