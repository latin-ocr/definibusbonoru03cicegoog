INTRODUCTION

to combine hedonism with altruism. ‘The greatest
happiness of the greatest number’ is a formula that

- has no counterpart in antiquity. The problem that

Stoicism: its
oac-

occurs when the claims of self conflict with those of
others was not explicitly raised by Epicurus But it
is against the egoism of his Ethics at least as much
as against its hedonistic basis that Cicero's criticisins
are really directed.

The Stoics paid much attention to Logic, ln this Ἰ

department they included with Dialectic, which they

developed on the lines laid down by Aristotle,
Grammar, Rhetoric, and the doctrine of the Criteriou,
The last was their treatment of the problem of know-
ledge. Like Epicurus they were purely empirical,
but unlike him they conceded to the Sceptics that
sensations are sometimes misleading, Yet true sensa-
tions‚they maintained,aredistinguishablefromfalse3
they have a ‘clearness' which compels the ‘assent’
of the mind and makes it ‘comprehend' or grasp
the presentatiou as a true picture of the external
object. Such a ‘comprehensible presentation,'
καταληπτικὴ φαντασία, is the eriterion os truth3 it is
‘a presentation that arises from an object actually
present, in conformity with that object, stamped on
the mind like the impress of a seal, and such as
could not arise from an object not actually present.’
So their much-debated formula was elaborated in
reply to Sceptioal critics. If asked how it happens
that false sensations do occur-eg„ that a straight
stick half under water looks crooked-the Stoics
replied that error only arises from inattention; care-
ful observation will detect the absence of one or
other os the notes of ‘clearness’ The Wise Man
