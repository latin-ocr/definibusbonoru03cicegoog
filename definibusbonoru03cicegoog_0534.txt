BOOK V. xxx

enormous profits it suffers a single loss. Does one

principle hold good in everything else, but another

in conduct? Will you not judge of the whole by

the largest part? Is there any doubt that virtue

occupies so large a part in human affairs that it

eclipses every other factor? Well then, Ι shall make

bold to call the other things in accordance with

nature ‘goods,' and not cheat them of their old

name, rather than excogitate some new one3 but I

shall place the massive bulk of virtue in the opposite
³2 scale of the balance. Believe me, that scale will glffiffitgloe
weigh down the earth and the scas. lt is a uni-
versal rule that any whole takes its name from its
most predominant and preponderant part. We
say that a man is a cheerful fellow3 but if he is
once in rather low spirits, has he therefore lost
his title to cheerfulness for ever? Well, the rule
was not applied to Marcus Crassus, who according
to Lucilius laughed but once in his life3 that one
exception did not prevent his being called agelustor,⁸
as Lucilius has it. Polycrates of Samos was called
‘the fortunate.’ Not a single untoward circum·
stance had ever befallen him, except that he had
thrown his favourite ring overboard at sea.b Did
that single annoyance then make him unfortunate?
and did he become fortunate again when the very
same ring was found in a fish’s belly? But Poly-

crates, if he was foolish (which he certainly was,
since he was a tyrant), was‘never happy; if wise, he
was not miserable even when crucified by Oroetes,
the satrap of Darius. ‘Burs you say, ‘many evils
befell him!' Who denies it? but those evils were
eclipsed by the magnitude of his virtue.⁰
