designed to achieve every kind of virtue3 hence dm&
children, without instruction, are actuated by senr— '
blances of the virtues, of which they possess in them-
selves the seeds, for those are primary elements of
our nature, which sceds sprout and blossom into
virtue. For we are so constituted from birth as to
contain within us the primary instincts of activity, of
affection, of liberality and of gratitude3 we are also
gifted with minds that are adopted to knowledge,
prudence and courage‚ and averse from their oppo-
sites; hence we see the reason why we observe in
children those sparks of virtue Ι have mentioned,
from which the philosopher’s torch of reason must
be kindled, that he may follow reason as his divine
guide and so arrive at nature’s goal. For as l have
repeatedly said already, in the years of immaturity
and intellectual weakness the powers of our nature
are discerned as through a mist3 but as the mind
grows older and stronger it learns to know the
capacity of our nature, while recognizing that this
nature is susceptible of further development and has
by itself only reached an incomplete condition.

is therefore the Pythian Apollo who bids us ‘know
ourselves’3 but the sole road to sels-knowledge is to
know the powers of body and of mind, and to follow
the path of life that gives us their full realization.
