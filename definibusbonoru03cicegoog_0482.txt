BOOK V. xvi-xvii

“Now inasmueh as our original instinct of desire Theperrection
was for the possession of the parts aforesaid in their {llllssffllss'elfem
fullest natural perfecti0n‚ it must be allowed that, thefflefsswd·
when we have attained the objectos our desire, our
nature takes its stand in this as its final End, and
this constitutes‘our ehief Good; and that this End
as a whole must be desired intrinsically and in and

several parts of it also have already been proved to

attractions of nature. But from this point on let us ffeffigbffffi
adopt a different line of reasoning, namely to show its own sake.
that, in addition to the argument from sels-love, the

fact that each part of our nature, both mental and

bodily, possesses. its own peculiar energy goes to prove
