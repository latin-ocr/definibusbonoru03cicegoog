achievement, constitutes success. The only ‘failure,'
‘error’ or ‘sin’ (the term ἁμάρτημα, includes all
these notions) is the conduct of the rational being
who ignores and violatcs nature.

In identifying the Good with Virtue and in inter-
preting Virtue by the conception of Nature, the
Stoics were following their forerunners the Cynics3
but they parted company with the Cynics in finding
a place in their scheme for Goods in the ordinary
sense. For though they place pleasure among
things ‘absolutely indifferent,’ their examples of
things ‘promoted'-life, health, wealth, etc—are
pretty much the usual objects of man's endeavour.
Hence, whereas the CynicS, construing ‘the natu-
ral’ as the primitive or unsophisticated, had run
counter to convention and even to decency, the
Stoics in the practical rules deduced from their
principles agreed in the main with current morality,
and included the recognized duties to the family
and the state.

But their first principles themselves they enunci- .
atcd in a form that was violently paradoxical· Virtue
being a state of inward righteousness they regarded
as something absolute. Either a man has attained to
it, when he is at once completely wisc, good and
happy, and remains so whatever pain, sorrow, or
missortune may befall him; or he has not attained to
it, in which case, whatever progress he has made
towards it, hc is still foolish, wicked and miserable.
So stated, the ideal was felt to be beyond man's
reach. Chrysippus, the third head of the school,
confessed that he had never known a Wise Man.
Criticism forced the later Stoics to compromise.
