Epicurean
Ethics.

body is dissolved by death, Death therefore means
extinction.

Thus man was relieved from the superstitious that
preyed upon his happiness—sear of the gods and
fearof punishment after death. But a worse tyranny

He gave his atoms a uniform vertical velocity, but
supposed them to collide by casually making a slight
sideway movement. This was the minimum hypo-
thesis that he could think of to account for the
formation of things; and it served his purpose by
destroying the conception of a fixed order in Nature.
The capacity to swerve is shared by the atoms that
compose the human soul; hence it accounts for the .
action of the will, which Epicurus regards as entirely
undetermined. In this fortuitous universe man is
free to make his own happiness,
