this process result the whole of the things that exist
and that we see. Moreover, this movement of the
atoms must not be conceived as starting from a be· Α
ginning, butas having gone on from all eternity.

18 Epicurus for his part, where he follows Democritus,
makes no serious blunders. Still, there is a great
deal in each of them with which l do not agree, and
especially this: in the study of Nature there are two
questions to be asked, first, what is the matter out
of which each thing is made, second, what is the force
by which it is made ; now Democritus and Epicurus
have discussed the question of matter, but they have
not considered the question of force or the efficient
cause. But this is a defect shared by both; I now
come to the lapses peculiarto Epicurus He believes
that these same indivisihle solid bodies are borne hy
their own weight perpendicularly downward, which

9 he holds is the natural motion of all bodies3 but then
in the very same breath, being sharp enough to
recollect that if they all travelled downwards in
a straight line, and, as I said, perpendicularly‚ no one
aiom would ever be ahle to overtake any other atom,
he consequently introduced an idea of his own inven-
tion: he said that the atorn makes a very tiny swerve,
-the smallest divergence possible3 and so are pro-
duced entanglements and combinations and cohe-
sions of atoms with atoms, which result in the creation
of the world and all its parts, and of all that in them
is. Now not only is the whole of this affair a piece
of childish fancy, but it does not even achieve the
result that its author desires. The swerving is itself
an arbitrary ficti0n; for Epicurus says the atoms
swerve without a causa—yet this is tho capital
offence in a natural philosopher, to speak of some-
