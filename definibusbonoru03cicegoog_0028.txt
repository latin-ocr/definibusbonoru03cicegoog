never ‘assents' to an ‘incomprehensible presenta-
tion)

In contradiction to EpicuruS, the Stoics taught Stoic
that the universe is guided by, and in the last resort Physica
is, God. The sole first cause is a divine Mind, which
realizes itself periodically in the world-process. But
this belief they expressed in terms uncompromisingly
materialistic, Only the corporea] exists, for only the
corporea] can act and be acted upon. Mind there-
fore is matter in its subtlest form; it is Fire or
Breath (spirit) or Aether. The primal fiery Spirit
creates out of itself the material world that we know,
and itself persists within the world as its beat, its
‘tensium’ its soul; it is the cause of all movement,
and the source of life in all animate creaturos, whose
souls are detached particles of the world-soul.

The notion of Fire as the primary substance the
Stoics derived from Heracleitus, Of the process of
creation they offered an elaborate account, a sort of
imaginury physics or chemistry, operating with the
hot and cold, dry and moist, the four elements of
fire, air, earth and water, and other conceptions of
previous physicists, which came to them chiefly
through the Peripatetics.

The world-process they conceived as going on
according to a fixed law or formula (λόγος), effect
following cause in undeviating sequence. This law
they regarded impersonally as Fate, or personally as
divine Providence3 they even spoke of the Deity as
being himself the Logos of creation. Evidences of
design they found in the beauty of the ordered
world and in its adaptation to the use and comfort

,of man. ‘Apparent evil is but theneaessary imperfec-
tion of the parts as parts3 the whole is perfectly good.
