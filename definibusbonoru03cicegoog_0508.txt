human beings (since our belief rs that all mankind ⁰⁰⁰⁰⁰⁰⁰⁰
are ¹united ln one society) are things desirable for
their own sakes. Yet none of these relations is
such as to form part of the End and Ultimate Good.

8 Hence it results that we find two classes of things
desirable for their own sakes.; one class consists of
those things which constitute the Ultimate Good ,
aforesaid, namely goods of mind or body; the latter
set, which are external goods, that is, goods that
belong neither to the mind nor to the body, such as
friends, parents, children, relatives and one's country
itself, while intrinsically precious to uS, yet are not
included in the same class as the former. Indeed,
no one could ever attain the Chief Good, if all those
goodS, which though desirable are external to uS,
formed part“ of the Chief Good.

is that it is in this way: we maintain these external
goods by those acts of duty which spring from the
particular class of virtue connected with each. For
example, dutiful conduct towards friends and parents
benefit ts the doer from the very fact that such per·
formance of duty' rs a right action, and right actions
take their nse from virtues. And whereas the Wise‚1.oveorh0n0u
