BOOK Ι. 111

The second class of critics‚ who, however much theya naor
approve of philosophy, nevertheless would rather ‘¹¹⁰' ⁰³¹¹ auo
have it less eogerly prosecuted‚ are asking for a
'restraint that it is not easy to practise. The study
isone thatwhen oncetaken upadmitsofno restrictiori
or control. ln fact, the attitude of the former class,
who attempt to dissuade us from philosophy alto-
gether, seems almost less unreasonable than that of
those who would set limits to what is essentially un-
limited, and expect us to stop half-way in a study

3 that increases in value the further it proceeds. If
Wisdom be attainable‚ let us not only win but enjoy
it; or if attainment be difficult, still there is no end
to the search for truth, other than its discovery. It
were base to flag in the pursuit, when the object pur-
suedis so supremely lovely. Indeed if we like writing,
who would be so churlish as to debar us from it? Or
if we find it a labour, who is to set limits to another
man’s exertions? No doubt it is kind of Chremes
in Terence’s play to urge his new neighbour

Neither to dig nor plough nor burdens bearat

for it is not industry in general, but toil of a menial
kind, from which he would detor him; but only a
busybody would take exception to an occupation
which, like mine, is a labour of love

Roman, as to despise and reject the Medea of Ennius
